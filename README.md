# Game Wrapper for DOSBox

These are my scripts, written in Ruby, for taking a DOS game and wrapping it
with DOSBox for play on Windows and OSX.  
這是方便把DOS GAME包裝成Windows ,OS X APP Script.主要是用Ruby寫的.

## How it works

You need a DOS game that you own. Don't ask me to help you pirate stuff. But if you have a game you bought and you want to run it, that's what this is for.
It uses DOSBox (the open-source emulator) and creates an app that you can run.
You click the icon, DOSBox loads,  the gmae runs, and when you quit, 
everything exits automatically, just like any of your other games.

I built this to play Epic Pinball cos I love that game. 

## Using with your own games


1. Create a new folder, like EpicPinball
2. Copy these files into that folder
3. Place your game's files in the `game` folder.
4. Create icons in ico and icns format and overwrite the originals. http://iconverticons.com/ is a great converter.
5. Modify the dosbox.conf.osx and dosbox.conf.win files to run your game's executable. There's lots to tweak here, and you're on your own for this. Make sure to put the game's executable at the bottom of the file!!!
6. run `ruby make_win_app.rb` to build the Windows files
7. run `ruby make_mac_app.rb` to build the Mac files
8. Optionally, create an installer for your game with InnoSetup


Don't like these steps? Patches welcome!

## Additional notes

For CD games, put the CD image and the files in the `game` folder like this:

`game\hd`  contains the files that would go on the hard drive
`game\cd`  contains the CD image

Then your configuration files would do something like this:

```

mount c game/hd

imgmount D "game/cd/x-wing.iso" -t iso

c:
call xwingcd2.bat
exit
````
